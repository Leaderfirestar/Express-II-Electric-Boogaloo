# Express-II-Electric-Boogaloo

The Main learning objectives in this course was to get a better understanding of how express ties everything together, learn how to handle authentication, and how to incorporate a sql database into our website.

The main challenges I had with this project was understanding how specifically controllers were called, and how to populate the database. It was quite different than mongodb. The big takeaway from this project (for me at least) was the for loop. I wasn't entirely sure how to pull information from the database, and the for lead in leads gave me a good idea of how to do it, and do it well.
